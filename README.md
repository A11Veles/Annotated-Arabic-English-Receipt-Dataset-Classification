# Annotated-Arabic-English-Receipt-Dataset-Classification
# Model Evaluation Summary
The Annotated-Arabic-English-Receipt-Dataset-Classification project was evaluated across 18 checkpoints, with the number of records increasing from 50 to 900. At each checkpoint, the modelâ€™s F1 score was compared to a dummy baseline.

# Key findings:
The model (using phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf) consistently achieved an F1 score of 0.000 at every checkpoint.
There was no improvement over the dummy baseline at any stage.
Conclusion:
The current model configuration did not outperform the dummy classifier and failed to learn meaningful patterns from the data. Further investigation into model architecture, or training strategy is mandatory.
